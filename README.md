This project aiming at driving an old ISDN Sinus 421 HandPhone LCD display.
<p></p>The biggest problem is that I can't figure out the type of LCD display driver.<br>
I hooked up my LogicAnalyser to see what is happening on the bus,but I couldn't find all command that I want.<br>
I can do the init section,turning on/off the display,and I can choose rows where I want to print,but I can't jump intro lines (like goto(x,y) at Glcd libs).<br>
I uploaded some captured data (I used Saleae Locig Software).
