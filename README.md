This project aiming for drive an old ISDN Sinus 421 HandPhone LCD display.
<p></p>The most problem is NO DATASHEET<br>
I hooked up my LogicAnalyser to see what is happening on the bus,but i couldn't find all command that I want.<br>
I can do the init section,turn on and off the display,and i can choose row,but i can't jump intro the line like goto(x,y) yet.<br>
I uploaded some captured data,I used Saleae Locig Software.
